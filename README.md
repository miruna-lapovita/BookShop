Hello traveller!

Have a look thorugh my Fairytale Book Shop, given by a C++ code meant to let you buy books with a system of bancknotes.
Let me walk you through the basic process:

->First, you'll get to choose if you want to go further as a user or an admin
  -> If you choose admin, you'll be asked to enter a password (it's 2604 but if you mess it up we'll let you know;))
  -> After you get past security, the admin's menu will open up, meaning you'll be able to:
     -add a book
     -delete a book
     -update a book
     -find a book by id
     -show all books
     -sort books by price
     -generate the most expensive book in the store
     -access user menu
   ->If you choose user menu, you'll go to a whole other thing:
     -> a list of books available will show up
     -> we'll ask you to give the id of the book you want
     -> we'll tell you the price and you'll choose how you want to pay buy entering bancknotes.(If your book costs 33 nickles, 
     you'll give us 10, we'll tell you to add more, than you add 10, 10, and maybe 5 and we'll give back 2 nickles as change)
     -> after that, you can choose to repeat the process with another book or finish your errand.
     -> when you finish your errand, we'll show a list of your orders and wish you safe travels XD

     Have fun!
